# 🚀 ClickForCharity Social Media Extension - Quick Reference

## 📍 Current Status: MVP COMPLETE ✅

**Ready for beta testing!** The extension is fully functional and waiting for testers.

## 🔗 Key Links

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/andysavage/clickforcharity-social-media-extension
- **Project Documentation**: https://nimno.net/sites/clickforcharity-net/social-media-team/
- **ClickForCharity Main Site**: https://clickforcharity.net/

## 🎯 What This Extension Does

Coordinates social media promotion tasks for ClickForCharity recipients:
- **Boosts engagement** (likes, comments, reposts)
- **Improves SEO** through coordinated Google searches
- **Supports partners** like Lightning.news
- **Gamifies helping** with points and progress tracking

## 🛠 Installation for Testing

1. **Load in Chrome**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `social-media-team-extension` folder

2. **Start Testing**:
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
   - Click "Start Tasks" and follow instructions
   - Complete 2-3 task cycles for full experience

## 📊 Current MVP Features

✅ **Working Features**:
- Chrome extension with polished UI
- 3 test tasks (Nostr, SEO, Partner support)
- Timer system with countdown
- Points and statistics tracking
- Settings management
- Task progress monitoring

⚠️ **MVP Limitations** (Intentional for Testing):
- Tasks are hardcoded (no server needed)
- No user accounts yet
- Basic verification only
- 3 fixed tasks only

## 🧪 Beta Testing Goals

**Key Question**: *Will volunteers actually use this to help ClickForCharity?*

**Test These Aspects**:
1. **Usability** - Is the interface intuitive?
2. **Motivation** - Do points/progress motivate continued use?
3. **Technical** - Does it work reliably across systems?
4. **Value** - Do users feel they're making a difference?

## 🎯 Beta Testing Process

1. **Recruit 5-10 testers** (crypto community, charity supporters)
2. **Give them installation guide** (docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
3. **Have them complete multiple task cycles**
4. **Gather feedback** on experience, bugs, suggestions
5. **Decide**: Build full backend or iterate on concept

## 💡 No Backend = Smart Testing

**Why MVP has no server**:
- ✅ Zero costs during testing
- ✅ No technical dependencies
- ✅ Fast iteration on feedback
- ✅ Validates concept before big investment

**Backend comes later** (Phase 2) only if testing validates the concept.

- **No server needed** - everything runs locally
- **Fixed tasks** - can't add new ones (intentional limitation)
- **Chrome only** - Firefox support in Phase 2
- **Development mode** - not published to Chrome Web Store yet

## 🔄 Next Steps After Beta Testing

**If feedback is positive**:
- Plan backend API development
- Design user account system
- Build admin dashboard for task management
- Add dynamic task loading
- Integrate with ClickForCharity.net

**If feedback needs work**:
- Iterate on UI/UX based on feedback
- Adjust task types and workflows
- Modify gamification approach
- Consider alternative approaches
