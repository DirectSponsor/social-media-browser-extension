# ClickForCharity Social Media Team Browser Extension - Project Summary

## Current Status: PLANNING PHASE ðŸ“‹

A browser extension to coordinate social media promotion tasks for ClickForCharity.net recipients through guided, automated workflows.

## Project Overview

### Core Concept
Create a browser extension that guides volunteers through specific social media promotion tasks to:
- Boost engagement (likes, comments, reposts, subscriptions)
- Improve SEO rankings through coordinated searches and visits
- Generate authentic social proof by posting about recipients' progress
- Earn revenue for recipients via PaidToPromote and similar platforms
- Enable effective collaboration through coordinated task completion

### Why Browser Extension?
- **Manual coordination too tedious** - Users expect polished, seamless experiences
- **Proven concept** - ClicksPaid.com already demonstrates this workflow successfully
- **Step-by-step guidance** - Extension can verify each action and provide next steps
- **Scalable impact** - Small consistent actions from many people = big results

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Task Queue System** - Present tasks one at a time with clear instructions
2. **Page Detection** - Know when user is on the right site/page
3. **Action Verification** - Confirm clicks, form submissions, time spent, etc.
4. **Progress Tracking** - Show completion status and points/rewards
5. **Task Coordination** - Pull tasks from ClickForCharity server dynamically
6. **User Interface** - Clean, intuitive popup for task instructions

### Example Task Flow
1. Start from ClickForCharity tasks page
2. Go to Google with specific search term (auto-copied to clipboard)
3. Search for target domain in results
4. Click the correct result
5. Scroll and spend 15 seconds on page
6. Click specified internal link
7. Navigate to partner site (e.g., Lightning.news)
8. Complete and report back to extension

### Multi-Benefit Design
Each task helps multiple goals simultaneously:
- Promote Nostr/social platforms
- Increase ClickForCharity profile views
- Improve site SEO and bounce rates
- Generate revenue from ads/traffic
- Support partner sites (Lightning.news, etc.)
