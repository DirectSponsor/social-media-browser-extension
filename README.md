# ClickForCharity Social Media Team Browser Extension

> A browser extension to coordinate social media promotion tasks for ClickForCharity.net recipients through guided, automated workflows.

## üéØ Project Overview

This browser extension enables volunteers to efficiently promote ClickForCharity.net recipients through coordinated social media tasks. Instead of manual coordination, the extension guides users through specific workflows that:

- **Boost engagement** (likes, comments, reposts, subscriptions)
- **Improve SEO rankings** through coordinated searches and visits  
- **Generate authentic social proof** by posting about recipients' progress
- **Earn revenue** for recipients via PaidToPromote and similar platforms
- **Enable effective collaboration** through coordinated task completion

## üöÄ Current Status: Planning Phase

- [ ] Project setup and architecture design
- [ ] MVP extension development 
- [ ] Beta testing with small group
- [ ] Iteration based on feedback

## üí° Why This Approach?

**Manual coordination proved too tedious** - Users expect polished, seamless experiences. The ClicksPaid.com browser extension already demonstrates this workflow successfully, proving the concept works.

**Each task creates multiple benefits simultaneously:**
- Promotes Nostr/social platforms
- Increases ClickForCharity profile views  
- Improves site SEO and bounce rates
- Generates revenue from ads/traffic
- Supports partner sites (Lightning.news, etc.)

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Task Queue System** - Present tasks one at a time with clear instructions
- **Page Detection** - Know when user is on the right site/page
- **Action Verification** - Confirm clicks, form submissions, time spent, etc.
- **Progress Tracking** - Show completion status and points/rewards
- **Task Coordination** - Pull tasks from ClickForCharity server dynamically

### Example Task Flow
1. Start from ClickForCharity tasks page
2. Go to Google with specific search term (auto-copied to clipboard) 
3. Search for target domain in results
4. Click the correct result
5. Scroll and spend 15 seconds on page
6. Click specified internal link
7. Navigate to partner site (e.g., Lightning.news)
8. Complete and report back to extension
